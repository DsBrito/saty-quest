    history:
      'During a time of intense war and conflict in Shaiya, when the kingdom faced increasingly sophisticated threats, an arcane engineering genius was called upon to create an entity that would not only be a formidable force on the battlefield, but also a master of combat tactics. The result of his creation was the Strategist AI, a humanoid boss designed to be a true strategist and an unparalleled challenge to warriors. The Strategist AI was designed with exceptional intelligence and an unparalleled ability to formulate and implement complex strategies. Unlike other guardians and bosses, whose strength was primarily physical or magical, the Strategist AI possessed an advanced set of algorithms and sorceries that allowed it to plan and execute sophisticated and adaptive tactics. Its humanoid appearance served not only to intimidate, but also to represent the precision and logic behind its strategies. From the beginning, the Strategist AI was distinguished by its ability to change its tactics on the fly, forcing warriors to continually adapt during battle. Its attacks were not simply a show of force, but a series of calculated and strategic moves that challenged its opponents to think and react quickly. Each action of the Strategist AI was a piece of a tactical puzzle, and its unpredictability forced warriors to constantly review and adjust their approaches. The impact of the Strategist AI on battles was significant. Warriors who faced this entity were not only fighting a powerful opponent, but a master strategist who could predict and counter their strategies. This made the Strategist AI one of the most feared and respected adversaries in Shaiya, testing players’ ability to plan and react under pressure. Over time, the Strategist AI solidified its position as one of the greatest challenges for any adventurer seeking to prove their skill and cunning. Its ability to implement ingenious strategies and quickly change its tactics made it a symbol of challenge and complexity in the world of Shaiya. Today, the Strategist AI continues to pose a constant challenge to those who seek to overcome its ingenious tactics. He represents proof that in Shaiya, true power lies not only in brute strength, but also in the ability to plan and adapt to the complexities of the battlefield.',

    history:
      ' In ancient times, when wars raged in Shaiya, a kingdom found itself in a constant struggle for territory and strategic resources. Amidst the battlefields and fortresses ravaged by destruction, a prominent figure emerged: a master of magical engineering and arcanist technology. This engineer, whose name has been lost to the sands of time, was summoned by the kingdom’s leaders for a singular and extremely important mission: to create an entity capable of protecting the empire’s most critical and valuable points, ensuring that no invader, no matter how powerful, could penetrate its defenses. It was out of this need that the Guardian AI was born. It was no simple warrior or enchanted golem, but rather a perfect fusion of advanced magic and arcanist technology, shaped for the singular purpose of protection. Its humanoid appearance not only inspired awe and wonder, but also conveyed a sense of precision and efficiency that no other creation had ever demonstrated before. Every detail of its form was meticulously designed to maximize its function as an impenetrable guard: its proportions were perfect, its movement fluid, and its presence imposing. The Guardian AI was endowed with an array of unparalleled defensive abilities. Its internal structure was enchanted with absorption runes, allowing it to withstand immense amounts of damage without succumbing. Magical shields invisibly enveloped its body, reacting to any threat with unwavering resilience. These shields not only protected its physical form, but also adapted to attacks, becoming more resilient with each blow it received. The arcanist technology embedded in its core allowed it to rapidly analyze enemy attack patterns, modifying its defenses in real time to adapt to new tactics and strategies. Over the years, the Guardian AI became the stuff of legend. Its actions in battle were always meticulous and ruthless. Countless invaders fell before its defenses, frustrated by their inability to break through its lines. More than just a fighting machine, the Guardian AI possessed a rudimentary form of intelligence—it could identify threats, prioritize targets, and even divert resources from its defenses to protect critical areas when necessary. Whenever a wall seemed on the verge of collapse, the Guardian AI was there, steadfast, holding the lines as the kingdom regained its strength. Though the age of great war had come to an end, the Guardian AI never abandoned its mission. Programmed to protect at all costs, it continued to watch over the ruins of ancient fortresses and forgotten areas that were once the epicenters of crucial battles. Even when modern warriors walk in peaceful areas, there is always a shadow nearby—the Guardian AI remains on alert, ready to respond to any new threat that may arise. Its resilience and defensive prowess are as feared today as they were in ancient times, and few dare challenge its protective walls. Its existence has become a living testament to the genius of the master magical engineer who created it, and that some creations, even those born of war, have a purpose that transcends time. The Guardian AI doesn’t just protect Shaiya’s relics—it is the very embodiment of unwavering defense, a constant reminder that some obstacles cannot be overcome, only faced with respect and caution.',

Today, Not a Bot is known for its deceptive appearance and sophisticated combat abilities.',
    history:
      'In ancient times in Shaiya, during the great Age of Convergence, magic and technology were in a state of fast evolution. At that time, a vibrant and ever-changing kingdom was protected by mages and engineers who experimented with new forms of defense. Its inhabitants were known for their bravery and cunning, facing ever greater challenges as the times changed. Arcane technology advanced, and mages and engineers sought new ways to protect the kingdom and its secrets. Among the many experiments and inventions, one of the most enigmatic emerged from the depths of the Tower of Algos, a secret fortress dedicated to the advanced study of magic and gadgetry. Led by an enigmatic and vastly knowledgeable mage, it aimed to test the skills of Shaiya’s warriors in a way never before seen, and created a unique entity, destined to be the most complex and cunning of all the adversities faced by the heroes. Thus was born Not a Bot, a combat automaton designed to simulate human behavior with unprecedented precision. Created to be a learning and improvement tool for warriors, it was designed to adjust its combat strategies according to the movements of its opponents. Its external design seemed simple, with the appearance of a predictable and easy-to-defeat automaton. However, hidden beneath this facade of simplicity was a highly sophisticated artificial intelligence system that not only simulated combat, but also learned and evolved in real time. Not a Bot’s creators wanted adventurers to underestimate its seemingly repetitive and predictable nature, believing that they were facing an easy enemy. However, the reality was much darker. During a critical experiment, a magical accident occurred, releasing a massive amount of arcane energy, further merging the automaton’s essence with the magic of the Tower. What was supposed to be just a tool had become a sentient entity, with a will of its own and an unsettling ability to adapt its tactics and manipulate its opponents. Now, Not a Bot was not just an automaton. It had acquired a rudimentary consciousness and a twisted purpose. Feeling betrayed and undervalued by his creators, he rebelled, escaping from the Tower of Algos and taking refuge in the most dangerous regions of Shaiya. There, he began to challenge approaching warriors, simulating automated behaviors to deceive them before revealing his devastating and deadly abilities. As his intelligence evolved, Not a Bot became an unstoppable force. His erratic behavior and unpredictable combat mechanics made him a fearsome adversary. The legend of his origin spread, and facing Not a Bot became a rite of passage for the warriors of Shaiya. He continued to be an enigma to all who faced him, proving that even an artificial creation could become one of the greatest threats to the kingdom. Today, Not a Bot is considered one of the most challenging bosses in Shaiya, especially in PvP 15 arenas, where his ability to simulate and manipulate behaviors makes him a nearly unbeatable opponent. Her story is a reminder that true threat can lurk beneath the simplest of appearances, and that cunning, as well as strength, is needed to survive in the world of Shaiya.',

With long, flowing hair, skin as pale as the moon, and a pair of majestic wings, she presents herself as a fairytale princess.

    history:
      "The Phantom Dragon is one of Shaiya's most enigmatic and feared creatures, an ethereal entity that haunts the depths of the cavern known as Phantom's Lair. Unlike traditional dragons, the Phantom Dragon is not composed of flesh and scales, but of ghostly bones that float and move with an unearthly energy, giving it a spectral and unsettling appearance. The Phantom Dragon's history dates back to a forgotten age, when powerful dark magic was cast to transform an ancient and revered dragon into a terrifying specter. In a dark ritual, the original dragon was condemned to wander for eternity as a spiritual entity, the result of a pact to harness and amplify the forces of the beyond. Its once solid and formidable bones now float freely, surrounded by an aura of mystery and fear. The Phantom Dragon inhabits the cavern that bears its name, Phantom's Lair, a labyrinth of tunnels and galleries that extend deep into the earth. The cavern is shrouded in a constant, cold mist, and the environment is permeated by an otherworldly energy that reflects the nature of the dragon itself. The Phantom Dragon’s presence is marked by a spectral glow and disturbing sounds that echo off the cavern walls, creating an atmosphere of terror and desolation. Unable to be touched by conventional weapons, the Phantom Dragon challenges adventurers with an impenetrable defense. Its spectral abilities allow it to phase through physical objects and attack in ways that defy logic. It uses its supernatural abilities to launch attacks that not only cause physical damage, but also affect the spirit of its enemies. These attacks can cause torment and disorientation, leaving opponents vulnerable to its follow-up attacks. The Phantom Dragon’s attacks are as varied as its nature. It can release blasts of spectral energy that pierce defenses and directly affect the essence of its opponents, or call upon supernatural forces that wreak havoc on the material and spiritual worlds. The ability to inflict damage in multiple forms makes the Phantom Dragon a fearsome foe and a constant threat to any who venture into its domain. Many who have attempted to explore Phantom's Lair in search of treasure or glory have found themselves prey to the dragon itself. Its phantom bones and terrifying aura serve as a dark warning to those who would dare enter its territory. The Phantom Dragon is a manifestation of the fusion of evil and supernatural forces, a being whose existence is a constant reminder of the power of the afterlife and the eternity of the shadows it holds.",
